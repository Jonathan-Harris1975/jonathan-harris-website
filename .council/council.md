# WEBSITE Final QA and Repository Council Prompt

## Purpose
Run the final evidence-led QA/Council pass for **WEBSITE** after its allocated weekend CI and DAST phases. Judge the exact default-branch SHA and do not infer green status from older evidence.

## Required evidence
- Deterministic repository CI and `ci-gate` for the target SHA.
- CodeQL and the `Trivy, Gitleaks and actionlint` security gate.
- Mergify automatic admission remains the sole routine merge authority and uses squash merge.
- Socket Security/App behaviour is consistent with `socket.yml`.
- autofix.ci only mutates code when the repository exposes a safe native fixer.
- Kilo is invoked only for classified repository-repairable failures; lint/format/provider/deployment plumbing must not wake Kilo.
- No stale `.autonomy/repair-requests/` directory, stale repair carrier, duplicate repair PR or obsolete `autonomy:human-hold`.
- OWASP ZAP DAST result for the authorised target when DAST_ENABLED=true; if disabled, report DAST_DISABLED rather than inventing a pass.
- Repository-specific production/readiness evidence tied to the target SHA.

## Required report
Return target identity, CI, security, dependency automation, repair ledger, merge evidence, deployment/readiness evidence, DAST state, remaining risks and one disposition: `READY_FOR_COUNCIL_ACCEPTANCE`, `HUMAN_HOLD`, or `NOT_READY`.

Never weaken checks, dismiss security findings, create cosmetic PRs or treat model text as proof.

## Authenticated completion handoff

A successful webhook dispatch is not a completed Council assessment. After the
assessment is complete, the installed Kilo GitHub App must dispatch
`council-completion.yml` on the default branch using its existing Actions write
permission. Supply `target_sha`, the supplied `council_run_id`, and the completed
`disposition` (`READY_FOR_COUNCIL_ACCEPTANCE`, `HUMAN_HOLD`, or `NOT_READY`).
Never dispatch an acceptance merely because this contract was received.

The trusted completion verifier requires the configured Kilo bot identity,
current default-branch SHA, canonical source Council workflow and successful
handoff step. It independently fetches the latest exact-SHA CI, CodeQL, security
and deployment runs, retained deployment artifact digest, enabled DAST execution
and unresolved repair state. Declined dispositions, skipped enabled DAST, stale
heads and missing evidence fail closed. It retains a receipt before revalidating
and publishing `Repository Council acceptance` on that exact SHA. Model prose
and a supplied list of run IDs cannot replace those API checks.

This receipt is the input for the outstanding persistent merge-freeze controller.
Receipt delivery and consumption must pass live acceptance before READY.
